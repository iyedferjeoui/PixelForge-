# 🖼️ Python Image Filter

A Python image filtering tool with 13 filters (grayscale, sepia, blur, edge detection and more).
Built with Pillow & NumPy. Features an interactive menu, input validation and auto file renaming.
Originally a school project, extended to be more functional and beginner-friendly. 🖼️

## 💡 Why This Project?

This project is great for **beginners who want to learn**:
- How images work at the pixel level
- How to use Python libraries like Pillow and NumPy
- How to structure a simple interactive Python program
- Basic concepts of image processing (colors, filters, transformations)

Feel free to clone it, run it, and modify it to learn! 🚀

## ✨ Features

- 13 different image filters
- Interactive menu in the terminal
- Input validation (no crashes on wrong input)
- Automatic file renaming (applying the same filter twice saves both images, no overwriting)
- All results saved in an `output/` folder
